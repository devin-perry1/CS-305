Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

      Artemis Financial wanted to update their web-based software to be more modern and have better security. The updates
      need to be the most up to date available, and effective against incoming cyber-attacks. Some areas of concern that
      need to be addressed are the value of secure communications to the company, if the company has any international
      transactions, if there are any government restrictions about secure communication, what external threats there are,
      and what kind of modernization requirements there will be. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

      Software secuity is extremely important because it ensures that their client and their own information stays safe.
      When it comes to transactions this is extremely important. The main reason to code securely is to keep the bad
      people out, and away from getting precious information.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

      Each module was a little tricky to understand what I had to do, but after doing it once it was much easier. The
      hardest part was getting the https to become secure.
      

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

      To find potential weaknesses or security issues in the code, I integrated the Maven dependency-check plug-in into the
      code. I then ran the check on the application from Artemis Financial.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

      The maven dependency check helped me see what vulnerabilites there were before and after I refactored the code. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

      I made sure to keep everything organzied so if I needed to look ar it later I could easily tell what I was doing. 
      This would be helpful in most software development cases. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

      I think the best thing I did was the first part, which was writing down all the different aspects of the assignment. 
      Interpreting the client needs, addressing the areas of security, etc.
